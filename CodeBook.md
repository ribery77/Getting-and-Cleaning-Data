Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset [1]

Source Experiment & Data Set

The source data set represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data set archive can be downloaded from:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

The data is made available by Reyes-Ortiz, Anguita, Ghio, and Oneto from the Smartlab Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory in Genoa, Italy.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Source Files

The source files we use to create the tidy data set from the extrated data archive are:

features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
features.txt: List of all features.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
train/X_train.txt: Training set.
train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
test/X_test.txt: Test set.
test/y_test.txt: Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

train/subject_train.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
NOTE: We do not use the Inertial Signals for this tidy data set.

Variables

Variables within the tidy data set are as examined as follows (taken from [1]).

The activity labels consist of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The subjects who carried out the experiment are represented as a number from 1 to 30.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

Signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '*_[XYZ]$' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

For each measurement the mean, stddev, and mean frequency were calculated.

Transformations

Training and test data set rows were appended and then a unified data set created from the source files.

Measurements were extracted for mean, standard deviation for each measurement.

variable/column names were labeled with descriptive cleaner names.

Results were output as an indepenent tidy data set at ./data/TidyDataSet.txt
